# A1 Field Pro — Product Requirements Document

## Original problem statement
Create a production-ready SaaS field service management platform called "A1 Field Pro",
owned by A1 HVAC N DE-GO. Inspired by Workiz workflow but original with better UI/UX,
stronger automation, and full white-label capability.

Target industries: HVAC, Plumbing, Electrical, Appliance Repair, Garage Doors, Roofing,
Home Services. Multi-tenant SaaS architecture, modern, fast, mobile-first, dark-mode
capable, cleaner than Workiz, simpler than ServiceTitan.

## Adapted tech stack (per platform constraints)
- Frontend: React 19 + Tailwind + Shadcn UI + Phosphor Icons
- Backend: FastAPI + Motor (MongoDB async)
- Database: MongoDB (multi-tenant via `company_id` scoping)
- Auth: JWT in httpOnly cookies (bcrypt password hashing)
- Payments: Stripe Checkout via `emergentintegrations`

## User personas
- **Owner** — full access, billing, team, settings, all jobs.
- **Dispatcher** — creates and assigns work orders, schedules technicians.
- **Technician** — mobile-friendly "My Jobs" view: today's route, status updates, payment capture.

## Core requirements (static)
1. Multi-tenant: every record scoped by `company_id` from JWT.
2. Role-based access: owner / dispatcher / technician.
3. JWT in httpOnly cookies; FastAPI `withCredentials` on all axios calls.
4. CORS limited to frontend origin with credentials.
5. Stripe Checkout for per-job invoices.
6. Mobile-first technician view.
7. Red / Blue / White brand palette, Swiss high-contrast design.

## What's been implemented (Feb 2026 — v1)
- **Auth**: register (creates company + owner), login, logout, /me. Bcrypt + JWT cookies.
- **Companies & Team**: company seeded on signup; invite dispatchers / technicians; delete members.
- **Customers CRM**: list + create.
- **Jobs / Work Orders**: create, edit, delete, filter by status, assign technician, schedule, price.
- **Dashboard**: KPIs, pipeline funnel, recent jobs.
- **Schedule**: Week-view grid; jobs placed by `scheduled_at` & assignee.
- **Technician Mobile View**: Today/Upcoming/Completed, status-advance, one-tap charge.
- **Stripe Payments**: per-job checkout, polling status, auto job→completed+paid.
- **Marketing landing page**.
- **Demo seed**: 1 company, 3 users, 4 sample jobs.

## What's been implemented (Phase 1 — Feb 2026 — v1.1)
- **Job detail page** (`/app/jobs/:id`): editable notes, photo upload/grid/delete via Emergent object storage, customer signature pad (canvas → base64 PNG), inline status advance + Stripe charge.
- **Drag-and-drop schedule**: unscheduled sidebar; drag job onto day/hour cell → PATCH scheduled_at; auto-promotes status.
- **Public booking widget** (`/book/:companyId`): no-auth customer form → creates an unscheduled job tagged `source=booking_widget`; shareable link with Copy button in Settings.
- **Multi-tenant file isolation**: `/api/files/{path:path}` validates path prefix against JWT company_id.

Testing: backend 30/30 pytest pass (18 baseline + 12 phase 1); frontend critical flows verified.

## What's been implemented (Phase 2A — Feb 2026 — v1.2)
- **White-label branding**: owner-only `PATCH /api/companies/me` for primary + accent color; `POST /api/companies/me/logo` (multipart) stores logo via object storage and writes `company.branding.logo_path`. Settings UI: logo uploader, 5 color presets, primary/accent color pickers, Save button.
- **PDF Invoice**: `GET /api/jobs/{id}/invoice.pdf` generates a branded invoice (header bar in company primary color, total in accent, PAID stamp when paid) via reportlab. "Invoice PDF" button on JobDetail opens it in a new tab using same-origin httpOnly cookie auth.
- **Booking widget polish**: shadcn Calendar inside Popover replaces the native datetime picker for the "Preferred date" field; Settings page now exposes a copy-paste `<iframe>` embed snippet alongside the direct link.

Testing: backend 40/40 pytest pass (30 prior + 10 new); frontend critical flows verified.

## Backlog (prioritized)
### P0 — Phase 2B (next)
- Emergent-managed Google login
- TOTP MFA enrollment + verification
- Email invoice send (waiting on Resend or SendGrid API key from user)

### P1 — Soon
- Apple login (needs Apple Developer account from user)
- Logo display on landing/booking widget (currently saved but not yet rendered)
- Hex color validation (regex) before persisting
- Split `server.py` into routers (`auth`, `jobs`, `companies`, `files`, `public`, `payments`, `invoice`) — file is now ~920 lines

### P2 — Future
- Route optimization
- SMS notifications (Twilio)
- Recurring jobs / maintenance plans
- Reports / analytics export
- Mobile native app (React Native)
